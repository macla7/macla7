My name is Mitch Clark and I am an aspiring Full stack developer. I am self teaching from a variety of sources, but primarily through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a>. At the moment, nearly all of the projects on this account are small rudimentary projects, which were created often to cement and apply newly learned material. This means that often the projects can seem simple, but collectively they employ a whole range of different technologies, philosophies, and practises.

What I've dabbled with so far:

<ul>
  <li>Languages
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS (and SASS)</li>
      <li>Ruby</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Server-side frameworks
    <ul>
      <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Testing Frameworks
    <ul>
      <li>Jest</li>
      <li>RSpec</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Libraries
    <ul>
      <li>React</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
