My name is Mitch Clark and I am a self-taught Full Stack developer. I am self-taught from a variety of sources, but primarily through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a>. At the moment, nearly all of the projects on this account are small rudimentary projects from this course. This means that often the projects can seem simple, but collectively they employ a whole range of different technologies, philosophies, and practises.
